# File Read & Write Challenge üñãÔ∏è and Error Handling Lab üß™

## Overview

This project contains a Python program that demonstrates file handling capabilities by reading an input file, modifying its contents, writing the modified contents to a new file, and incorporates error handling by asking the user for a filename and managing errors gracefully.

---

## Features

- **File Read & Write Challenge**:  
  Reads a file provided by the user, modifies the content (e.g., converting text to uppercase), and writes the modified content to a new file.

- **Error Handling Lab**:  
  Prompts the user to enter a filename. If the file doesn't exist or cannot be read, the program will show an appropriate error message without crashing.

---

## How it works

1. The user is prompted to enter the filename of the file they want to read.
2. The program attempts to open and read the file.
3. If successful, the program modifies the content (e.g., converts it to uppercase).
4. The modified content is then written to a new file prefixed with `modified_`.
5. If the file is not found or an error occurs, the program displays a clear error message.
